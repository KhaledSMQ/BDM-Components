# Big Data Monitoring Brazil

##Introduction


This project define an architecture and systems already in use in Brazil able to process the massive amount of events that occur in a banking IT Infraestructure.
Those events are of different types, from a variety of sources and with different formats.

Depending on the nature of events, we will be processing them in a batch-oriented or near-realtime fashion.

To achieve this flexibility and big capability, we have defined Big Data Monitoring Brazil as a concrete implementation of the so called Lambda Architecture for Big Data systems.

Lambda Architecture defines three main layers for the processing of data streams: Batch layer, Speed layer and Serving layer.

##Technology Stack


In Brazil, Big Data Monitoring Brazil is comprised of a set of technologies that interact between them to implement these layers:

  - **Apache Kafka**: this is our data stream. Different systems will be generating messages in Kafka topics.
  - **HDFS**: this is where our "master dataset" is stored.
  - **MapReduce**: This is how our batch layer recomputes batch views. Mapreduce is also used for a batch ETL process that dumps data from Kafka to HDFS.
  - **Apache Storm**: This is what we use as our speed layer. Events are consumed from Kafka and processed into "realtime views"
  - **HBase**: This is where we store the "realtime views" generated by Storm topologies
  - **Apache Camel**: This is used for route and filter requests from data consumers of Big Data Monitoring Brazil 
  - **Redis**: This is used normalization and enrichment of raw data provided by collectors
  - **Neo4J**: This is used normalization and enrichment of raw data provided by collectors
  - **Elastic Search**: This is used data indexing
  - **WSO2 CEP**: This is used for Complex Event Processor allowing  analyse and react in realtime of a series of events and dispatch alerts accordingly
  - **GemFire**: This is used for scalable data store and high process throughput
